## Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool (Python)

This is a simple command-line encryption and decryption tool built using Python.

## Features
- Encrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher
- Decrypt encrypted messages
- Preserves spaces and special characters
- Uses modular arithmetic and ASCII shifting

## How It Works
Each letter in the message is shifted by a user-defined number.
For example, with shift 3:
HELLO → KHOOR

## Technologies Used
- Python
- String manipulation
- ASCII conversion (ord, chr)
- Modular arithmetic
